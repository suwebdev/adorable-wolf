                <p class="poemBody">
                I have a trim typewriter now,<br>
                They tell me none is better;<br>
                It makes a pleasing, rhythmic row,<br>
                And neat is every letter.<br>
                I tick out stories by machine,<br>
                Dig pars, and gags, and verses keen,<br>
                And lathe them off in manner slick.<br>
                It is so easy, and it's quick.<br>

                And yet it falls short, I'm afraid,<br>
                Of giving satisfaction,<br>
                This making literature by aid<br>
                Of scientific traction;<br>
                For often, I can't fail to see,<br>
                The dashed thing runs away with me.<br>
                It bolts, and do whate'er I may<br>
                I cannot hold the runaway.<br>

                It is not fitted with a brake,<br>
                And endless are my verses,<br>
                Nor any yarn I start to make<br>
                Appropriately terse is.<br>
                Tis plain that this machine-made screed<br>
                Is fit but for machines to read;<br>
                So Wanted (as an iron censor)<br>
                A good, sound, secondhand condenser!</p>
