            <h1>The Star</h1>
                <p class="poemBody">A white star born in the evening glow<br>
                Looked to the round green world below,<br>
                And saw a pool in a wooded place<br>
                That held like a jewel her mirrored face.<br>
                She said to the pool: "Oh, wondrous deep,<br>
                I love you, I give you my light to keep.<br>
                Oh, more profound than the moving sea<br>
                That never has shown myself to me!<br>
                Oh, fathomless as the sky is far,<br>
                Hold forever your tremulous star!"<br>
                But out of the woods as night grew cool<br>
                A brown pig came to the little pool;<br>
                It grunted and splashed and waded in<br>
                And the deepest place but reached its chin.<br>
                The water gurgled with tender glee<br>
                And the mud churned up in it turbidly.<br>
                The star grew pale and hid her face<br>
                In a bit of floating cloud like lace.</p>
