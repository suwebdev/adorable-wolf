                    <p class="poemBody">
                    Wine comes in at the mouth<br>
                    And love comes in at the eye;<br>
                    That's all we shall know for truth<br>
                    Before we grow old and die.<br>
                    I lift the glass to my mouth,<br>
                    I look at you, and I sigh.</p>
